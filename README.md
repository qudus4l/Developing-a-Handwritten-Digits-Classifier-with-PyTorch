# Handwritten Digits Classifier with PyTorch

This repository contains code and resources for building a Handwritten Digits Classifier using PyTorch. The goal of this project is to prototype a system for optical character recognition (OCR) on handwritten characters, specifically focusing on the MNIST database of handwritten digits.

## Project Overview

As a machine learning engineer, you have been tasked with providing a proof of concept for the OCR system. In this project, you will preprocess the MNIST dataset, build and train a neural network using PyTorch, and fine-tune the model for optimal performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/qudus4l/Handwritten-Digits-Classifier-with-PyTorch.git
   ```

2. Set up the environment:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

3. Explore the code and resources in the repository.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook `Handwritten_Digits_Classifier.ipynb`.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the dataset, build the neural network, and train the model.

4. Experiment with different hyperparameters, architectures, or techniques to improve the performance of the model.

5. load the model checkpoint and test the model on the test dataset.

## Resources

- The [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) of handwritten digits.
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), an open-source machine learning library used for building and training neural networks.
